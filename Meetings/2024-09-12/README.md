## AGENDA
BEST (Eddy Corthouts)
IMKL (Eveline Vlassenroot)
Persons (Mathieu Tulpinck, Liesbet D'Hondt, Eveline Vlassenroot)
Status collaboration agreement (Marc Bruyland, Dominique Buffet)
ICEG meeting on 25/9

Eric announces that François Dumortier is seriously ill and that it is unlikely that he will return before his retirement that is foreseen in 2025.
This will also lead to a change in the representation of the Brussels region in the ICEG committee.
Eric will think about a kind of encouragement to be sent to him on behalf of the ICEG review committee.

### BEST (Eddy Corthouts)
Eddy relaunches the request to publish a standard on BEST (Belgian Streets & Addresses).
Everybody agrees that ICEG is the place where such a standard should be published.
Ziggy adds that a formal check on the BEST documentation should be done to ensure that all elements are in place to publish the standard according to ICEG requirements.
A check needs to be done what budget will be required to do this check in addition to the 3d that were already estimated for the publication of the standard.
Flanders will check if the budget 2022 can be used or if we need to wait for the approved budget for 2024-2025.
Approval for using a budget from ICEG will be requested from the ICEG committee on Sep 25.

### IMKL (Eveline Vlassenroot)
As no objections were received in August, the ICEG committee will be informed that the standard is formally validated.
Eric asks to foresee an explanation regarding the impact of this decision, the deadlines involved and the communication that is foreseen.
Eveline adds that IMKL will be referred to in decretes of the regions.

### Persons (Mathieu Tulpinck, Liesbet D'Hondt, Eveline Vlassenroot)
Mathieu mentions that KSZ/BCSS is eager to know when a formal ICEG exercise can be started.
A letter on behalf of the ICEG committee to request support from the 2 main stakeholders needs to be finalized so that it can be presented to the ICEG committee on 25/9.

### Status collaboration agreement (Marc Bruyland, Dominique Buffet)
The collaboration agreement was blocked for a long time at BOSA; on 22/7 it was approved by BOSA's IF.
The document was then signed on behalf of the president of BOSA.
Flanders came with some (non fundamental) modifications to the text of the agreement; these changes were approved by the Legal department of BOSA.
On 1/8 a message from SPW indicated some difficulties to have the budget approved by their IF. Xavier said he hopes to unblock the situation in the month of September. 
BOSA is waiting for clarity given by SPW before continuing the signing round of the agreement.
The status will also be discussed in the meeting of the ICEG committee on 25/9.

### ICEG meeting on 25/9
Marc offers to integrate the different parts  into 1 support document.
Flanders will prepare and present the slides on IMKL and Persons.
Marc will present the topic on the collaboration agreement.

### Next meeting
The next meeting of the ICEG review committee is foreseen on Nov 11th.
