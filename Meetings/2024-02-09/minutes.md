## STATUS CURRENT TRAJECTORIES
### ICEG Building - formal accreditation
Jitse explains that the last comment coming from BPOST has been taken into consideration in the model. The ICEG review committee accepts the Building model as a new ICEG standard.

### ICEG Hydrants - status & next steps
Three additional workshops have been planned. The target is to land with a new standard in May 2024.

### IMKL - status & next steps
Ivy explains a number of key concepts, the timeline, the expectations towards ICEG and the next steps.

Concepts: 
- KLIM = a platform
  - KLIM-CICC: [Federal Cable and Pipeline Management Database](https://klim-cicc.be/information) for ground works on the territory of the Brussels+ Walloon Region
  - KLIP = [Kabel- en Leidinginformatieportaal](https://klip.vlaanderen.be/public) for ground works on the territory of the Flemish Region 
- IMKL = a data format
  - [INSPIRE Data Specification on Utility and Government Services – Technical Guidelines](https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/publications/inspire-data-specification-utility-and-government-services-technical-guidelines_en)
  - [IMKL format](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/help/klip/imkl-formaat) : used by cable and pipeline managers to pass on pipeline data to KLIP; based on the European exchange standard for cable and pipeline information (INSPIRE Utility Services, abbreviated 'INSPIRE US')

Present status: 
- IMKL is implemented in Flanders
- Brussels and the federal level want to use IMKL
- Wallonia have not taken a decision yet on IMKL

There is a need for a collaboration agreement; this will be addressed at the ICEG Committee of April 4th.
The members of the ICEG review committee are requested to inform their management who will participate at that ICEG meeting. Ivy will send some additional documentation and contact persons of the different stakeholders who were involved in the discussions so far.

With respect to data standardization, the work involved is
- aligning all stakeholders on the IMKL format
- publication of the standard at ICEG level
- the maintenance of the standard.

The process for defining ICEG data standards is described [here](https://github.com/belgif/review/tree/master/Process). Also a template for a project charter can be found here which is needed to start a new data standardization exercise at ICEG.

## ICEG OPPORTUNITIES 2024
### BeST
As requested by Paradigm, BOSA started with the documentation of the BEST model according to the ICEG standardization process (similar to the way the Building model has been documented).
For the publication of the documentation itself, BOSA needs help for the manipulation of the publication tool.
BOSA proposed to use 3 mandays of the 2022 budget to do the publication. Benoit refused stating that BOSA should not request budget for this purpose. 

BOSA will check internally if
- this needs to be escalated further,
- an alternative funding can be found or
- it will stick to the existing documentation that is already available on the ICEG github site.

### Person
Mathieu explains there is a need for developing a base registry model to cover dynamic aspects for handling person data.

The process for defining ICEG data standards is described [here](https://github.com/belgif/review/tree/master/Process). Also a template for a project charter can be found here which is needed to start a new data standardization exercise at ICEG.

### Planning 2024
As was discussed in earlier meetings, an overview of the year planning will be provided in the ICEG review committee.

### ICEG Training 2024 - need & content
The review committee decides to organise an ICEG interoperability training this year. Eveline will organise a preparatory meeting.

## ICEG MANAGEMENT COMMITEE 03/04/2024
### Budget & Status 2024
On Feb 9th, a meeting took place between Jack Hamande and David Wattecamps re the contribution of the Walloon region wrt the 2024 budget for ICEG data standardisation. The Walloon region is still interested in the initiative, but there was some confusion re the exact amount that still needed to be confirmed. Once this is done, the 2024 collaboration agreement for ICEG data standardisation will be presented to the persons who need to sign this document.
