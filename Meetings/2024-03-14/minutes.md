## STATUS CURRENT TRAJECTORIES

### IMKL - status & next steps
The IMKL collaboration agreement will be simplified: the cost aspect will not be integrated as in the first years very limited costs are expected. In the coming weeks it will become clearer which parties will be involved.

The official version of the standard is published on the belgif site on github: (https://github.com/belgif/ICEGthema-imkl/). Issue tracking will be done on this repository.

Ivy is still looking for a way to define distribution keys for the costs for maintaining the IMKL standard.

In order to promote IMKL to an interfederal ICEG standard, the following approach will be followed:
- a project charter will be written (no ICEG budget will be needed in this case as the development of the standard is already finished)
- 1 meeting with all stakeholders will be organized where the standard will be proposed
- if ok, the next ICEG review committee will do a last check on the quality of the proposed standard
- if ok, the standard will be submitted to the ICEG committee for ratification   

### Translation OSLO standards
The OSLO standards will be translated from Dutch to English, French and German and published in the 4 languages on the belgif site on github.
The diagrams and figures will not be translated: they remain in their original form.
Note that as a general rule for an ICEG standard, the diagrams and figures are available in English, whereas the labels are available in the 4 languages.

A new toolchain is being developed and will be available after the summer of 2024.

### Person

Meetings organized by KSZ/BCSS will take place until June 2024.

A need to define a registry model that tracks the evolution in time, came out of these meetings; also legal info besides factual info is an attention point.

A new standard can be developed under ICEG, if the National Register and KSZ/BCSS are willing to collaborate in the elaboration of such a standard.
Assuming this is the case, a project charter needs to be written and approval needs to be obtained from the ICEG committee to start a standardization exercise.
This approach can be explained to the members of the KSZ workgroup in one of the following meetings.

## ICEG OPPORTUNITIES 2024

### EDIB (European Data Innovation Board)

FPS Economy represents BE in EDIB. Some members of the ICEG Review Committee (Dominique Buffet and Eric Auqière) are involved in EDIB meetings.
They explain that FPS Economy is looking for delegating discussions around interoperability to ICEG.

The following approach is proposed:
- to connect ICEG with EDI, on a next EDIB meeting a pitch of the working of ICEG could be given; 
- likewise EDIB could further clarify their expectations towards ICEG

As ICEG is an official intiative re data standardization and interoperability, the question is raised why these topics don't come in a natural way to ICEG. In a next review committee ways to make ICEG more visible can be examined.


## VARIA

### ICEG collaboration agreement

The new collaboration agreement has been written. Legal BOSA gave its green light with respect to the legal aspects of the agreement.
The agreement has been sent to the contacts of the 6 involved parties.

For the moment, BOSA is waiting for the go of the financial inspector; once this is ok, the signing round will start.

BOSA also requested translations in French and German; these translations will be sent together with the Dutch version that will be signed.

### Training

Eveline will organize the preparatory meetings for the training.

### Next meeting

The next meeting will take place on May 23rd. 

Eric Auquière offered to have this meeting in presence at the Paradigm office.
