## STATUS TRAJECTORIES

### IMKL - status & next steps
The public review period has come to an end.
There was a  validation webinar with the stakeholders on 2024-05-14.
The standard receives a positive advice from the ICEG Review Committee and will be proposed to the ICEG committee of June 26th for ratification.
The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/belgif/thematic/tree/master/models/cable-pipe).

The 2 platforms (KLIP and KLIM) that will implement IMKL, will be ready by August 2025. 
A 2yr period will then be granted to the utility companies to offer their data in the IMKL format that will become mandatory end of 2027.
A cooperation agreement between the partners is expected to be signed before the summer, aiming to guarantee the maintenance of the standard.


### Person
A draft project charter was presented which received a positive advice from the ICEG Review Committee. The project will require external support and is thus depending on the collaboration agreement 2024-2025.
An estimation of the required budget still has to be made. Also a 1-pager describing the rationale for the project will have to be written.
With the budget estimation and the 1-pager, the ICEG Committee of June 26th will be requested to approve the start of the exercise, as soon as the collaboration agreement 2024-2025 will have been signed.

As all the service integrators and the National Register are involved, a large coverage of the governmental landscape will be covered by this initiative and a refactoring of SOAP to REST services of Person related data will follow the new datamodel.

### Hydrants
Jitse presents an overview of the activities conducted in the exercise. Interactions with the stakeholders took more time than initially expected. Therefore an additional budget of 20md is required to finalize the exercise.

The ICEG Review Committee gives a positive advice to this request. An estimation of the required budget in € still has to be made.
With the budget estimation, the ICEG Committee of June 26th will be requested to approve the extension of the exercise, as soon as the collaboration agreement 2024-2025 will have been signed.

## VARIA

### ICEG collaboration agreement
The collaboration agreement for 2024-2025 has not been signed yet.
BOSA's contribution to the budget is still not approved by the Financial Inspector (first introduction was done on 2024-03-11).
The lacking collaboration agreement is blocking the exercises Hydrants and Person and also the translation of the OSLO standards. 

### Next meeting

The next meeting will take place on June 12th. 

Eric Auquière offered to have a (hybrid) meeting on September 12th in the Paradigm office.

## ACTIONS
- Liesbet and Mathieu: make the budget estimation (md + €) + one-pager
- Rink & Jitse: make the additional budget estimation (md + €) for Hydrants
- Raf & Marc: prepare the ICEG committee of June 26th (to be discussed in the ICEG Review Committee on June 12th)
- Marc: further follow-up on the collaboration agreement
