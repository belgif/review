## Status ICEG Agreement
Almost 2 years after the agreement in principle by the ICEG committee (2023-12-13), the collaboration agreement has been signed by all parties.

Duration of the agreement: 2 years (2025-10-01 till 2027-09-30).

So far, alle exercises were administratively handled by Flanders (meaning: contracting external parties, sending invoices to other ICEG members).
With the new contract other parties could play this role as well.
For every exercise to be approved by the ICEG committee, this administrative role needs to be confirmed by the ICEG committee. 


## Overview of blocked exercises
Blocked data standardization exercises: 
- Person					        71,1 	K€  (contracting party Flanders ? other candidate ?)
- BEST documentation			13	K€    (contracting party Flanders ? other candidate ?)

These exercises received a GO from the ICEG Committee of 2024-09-25 to be started as soon as the new collaboration agreement is signed.

- Finalization of the Hydrants exercise (18,17 K€)  (contracting party Flanders ? other candidate ?)
