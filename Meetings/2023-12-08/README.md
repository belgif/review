# NOTES:

#	BeST – Evelyn Barreto (BOSA)
-	CONTEXT:
o	BeST has the objective to provide accurate address information
o	National level – based on the 3 regional address master data sets (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia), translated in English, French and German
o	One unique identifier for each Belgian address
-	QUESTION / NEED:	
o	Help needed for setup EA repo and GitHub (eg mailto:https://github.com/belgif/thematic/tree/master/models/building)
-	CONCLUSION:
o	Technical support could be foreseen under collaboration contract 2024
o	Estimate on effort will be provided by next ICEG review committee

#	Cities & Municipalities (codelist) – Inès Herbosch (FOD Justitie)
-	CONTEXT:
o	Acronyms list of all cities & towns in BE (incl. boroughs)
o	All unique acronyms, with s	tandard 4 characters in the original language (bilingual municipalities and facility municipalities also acronym created for the 'second' language)
o	No standardization, but based on methodology - written out as standards
o	Based on a number of databases and parties
o	Why? Simplification, uniformization, standardization and legality
-	QUESTION:
o	How to proceed and what could ICEG mean in this?
	Publication, inclusion in official databases needed
-	CONCLUSION:
o	Introduce Inès and the exercise in AADP an BeST (François Du Mortier)
	Done by Marc (BOSA)
#	ICEG Building – status and next steps – Florian Barthélemy (Digitaal Vlaanderen)
-	CONTEXT:
o	Model has not changed after the latest review committee
o	Questions, issues and comments have been directly addressed
o	Final remaining step is validation by the INSPIRE committee (via Paradigm)
	Is written communication, but low respons rate from Paradigm
	Next INSPIRE committee probably only in the beginning of 2024
o	Low response rate but follow-up from Paradigm (François Du Mortier)
-	CONCLUSION:
o	Await (and push) last INSPIRE step
o	Written communication to the ICEG review committee
o	Approval / accreditation of standard on next REVIW meeting

#	ICEG Hydrants – status and next steps – Vincent Feremans (Digitaal Vlaanderen)
-	CONTEXT:
o	Model includes feedback from the public review period
o	Water companies seek further alignment, between themselves and with firefighters and internal consensus before validating the model.
•	Postponing the closing webinar (6/12) was needed due to semantic discussion
o	Three scenario’s to proceed (choice needs to be made by ICEG):
•	Semantic agreement (20MD – 4 months)
•	Semantic agreement and adoption support (20MD + 20MD – 4 months)
•	Semantic agreement, adaption support and implementation support with pilot ( 20MD + 20MD + max 50MD) 
-	CONCLUSION:
o	The ICEG review committee choses to proceed with option 1: working toward semantic agreement (20MD – 4 months on contract 2022) and working toward accreditation of the semantic standard after the additional workshop

#	NeTeX – David Schoenmaekers & Mathieu Tulpinck
-	CONTEXT:
o	Intermodal exchange of planning and scheduling data has been further taken up by Digitaal Vlaanderen 
o	Model is finished, consists of 4 standards
o	Published on:
•	AP TimeTables
•	AP Sstopplaces
•	AP VehicleScheduling
•	VOC
-	CONCLUSION:
o	Standard is finalized

#	IMKL – status and next steps – Ivy Van De Kerckhove (KLIP)
-	CONTEXT:
o	In Flanders, the Cables and Pipelines Information Model was developed for the full digitisation of the KLIP in 2016, current model IMKL 2.3 has been in use since 2017 and is due for an update, initially of the theoretical model. This was done in cooperation with Digitaal Vlaanderen's OSLO team, so that the new Flemish standard is immediately also an OSLO standard. 
o	We knew that Brussels & Wallonia also want to make vector data exchange mandatory, so we have now directly involved them in the ongoing analysis project as well. The aim is to make the Flemish standard a national standard. We are doing this within the framework of ICEG.
o	In Flanders, validation rules will be written for the updated model in 2024, with effective application of IMKL 3.0 in KLIP in 2025.
o	Brussels & Wallonia are also working on an implementation from 2025. 
o	Currently, the theoretical or semantic model is just about ready and the public review period is running until the end of January 2024. 
-	QUESTION:
o	Adoption of the IMKL model under the ICEG governance, including a contract
o	Creation an ICEG based contract for ICEG including maintenance, but is that the way to go?
-	CONCLUSION:
o	Could be taken up with the new contract 2024 as short procedure (i.e. validation of the model with one workshop as proposed)
o	To be further discusses how to take up maintenance, is part of ICEG Process & Method
•	Eg via addendum?
o	To be taken to next ICEG review committee
