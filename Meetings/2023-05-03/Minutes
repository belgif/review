	**ICEG I'm Moving**
	  ***GOAL***: make the data and procedures accessible and executable to simplfy collaboration and integration of the various services and tools. In addition, we want to make the data and procedures easily reusable acros different governmental levels and public & private partners
	  ***Approach***: 
	    SotA review of CPOV, CPSV AP, IDPC/LDPC, Procedure, Case (Dossier) and Evidence (CCCEV) 
	    interviews with Raf Buyle (DV), Liesbeth D'hondt (BOSA), Marc Bruyland (BOSA), Veronique Volders (ABB), Pieter Vanhoutteghem (BOSA) & Stefanie Kerckhof (DV/ABB)
	    use case and requirement analysis: semantic ontology, division between listing rules and deploying executable procedures, case management, subprocedures and procedure as a sequence of steps
	  ***Findings***: 
	    growing demand for a standardized appraoch to descibe procedures
	    no LOD standard that describes the description of procedures
	    willingness to adopt and support
	  ***Conclusion***:
	    model aligns with existing mature vocabularies (only complementary terms additional)
	    missing of the concept business process in OSLO steps is now introduced
	    combining OSLO steps concepts and CCCEV concepts allow to bring existing vocs together
	  ***Next steps***: 
	    futher alignment with data is necessary
	    create a deeper insight in the needs (keeping SDG in mind) - strong need from ABB, but also withing LPDC
	    Finding will be written down in a report and delivered for publication on the GitHub Repo
	  ***Discussion***:
	    1. how is an appeal handled? is rather a devition, could be an extension of a use case where rules are applied (note: not everything can be seen as a rule - sometimes doesn't fit the business process)
	    2. would be good from a EU perspective to have specific cases from the business to translate these findings into something more practical > projects such as SEMIC could be interested to support
	    3. **TO DO**: search for cross border pilots and financing (eg. Veronique Volders ABB, Pieter Vanhoutteghem BOSA, Cathy (DAV) - follow up during next ICEG Review committee on June 8    
	  ***See presentation for model***
	

	**ICEG HYDRANTS**
	  Second meeting has passed with good feedback (first model presented)
	  next meeting scheduled MAy 23 (refined model will be presented)
	  Not a lot of participation from French speaking organisations (are needed for adoption)
	  Public review during summer period: OK 
	
  
	**ICEG BUILDING**
	  Additional iteration is planned on May 31st, invites have been send
	  Meeting will be in both Dutch and French (on explicit request)
	  Particpants will be reminded to review the model
	  
    
	**OSLO standard adoption proces**
	  Growing number of requests for shortened procedure for adoption of an OSLO standard
	  Suggested approach and cost:
	    Translation of 130+ OSLO standards in English as an inspiration and published, no working groups > cost for bulk translation (setup proces + translation): 130K€
	    With this inspiration, use cases could be selected (to be choosen and approved by ICEG review committee)
	      a) refinement of the trnaslated standard with at least one working group: quality assessment (5k€) + working group + public review of 1 month (8,1K€) - where needed an additional working group (+ precessing issues) à rato 8,1k€
	      b) a full standisation process is choosen as known (5 working groups) in ICEG process & Methodology: 71,1k€
	  ***Discussion:***
	    Additional budget to be taken to ICEG Meeting (21/06/2023)  
	    Search for additional financing via Europe (Georges Lobos), Interreg, ...
	    **TO DO**: see what additional funding would be possible, feedback on next ICEG Review Committee on June 8
	   
     
	**VARIA**:
	  ICEG Time Table & Planning - public review ends mid May - issues on github need to be looked at - next steps ?
	    **TO DO**: take up with DV to estimate the impact of the issues to define next steps - feedback at latest on next ICEG Review Committee on June 8
	  Persons (KSZ/BCSS exercise) - Geert Thijs and Liesbet D'Hondt want to have access to the ICEG toolchain - who can help ?
	    Problem is the publication of the UML diagram for iterations: is in EA repo and there a need to publish via the ICEG toolchain - pointer to modeling rules needed (EAP)
	    **TO DO**: take up with technical team DV how to manage and what can be done
