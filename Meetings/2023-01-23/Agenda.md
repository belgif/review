- who will contact the stakeholders for reviewing the proposed standard ? 

## Project charter "Subsidies" (Tamgnoue Guimfacq Valery - 15') 
Mail 2022-12-12 from Valéry:
"
Je travaille pour le Service Public Régional Bruxellois – SPRB-GOB autour de la valorisation des données dans la direction Data intelligence. Je vous contacte parce que nous initions des travaux sur l’uniformisation de la gestion des subsides. 
Au niveau du model de données, nous nous sommes posés la question de savoir si un travail similaire n’était pas en cours ou en gestation à l’ICEG. 
Nous savons qu’il existe déjà un model en Flandre,  [Besluit Subsidie](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/besluit-subsidie), mais nous n’avons aucune idée de ce qui se fait au niveau fédéral sur cette thématique.
"

**Questions:**
- where is the project charter ? **Valery mentioned that the Brussels Region still needs to align internally. A project charter is not available yet. He thinks there will be a need for translating the OSLO standard, but he does not expect many adjustments on the content.**

## Publication of the datamodel "BEST" via github (Benoît Fricheteau - 15')
mail Benoit 2022-10-24:

"
A. Gouvernance du modèle BeSt: Le modèle doit être documenté in extenso sur Github, dans le répertoire belgif (UML complet détaillant toutes les classes, les coded values, catalogue d’objets définissant les classes et attributs, ainsi que xsd)
C. Calendrier: BOSA mettra tout en œuvre pour que tout le projet BeSt soit documenté sur github endéans les 6 mois, ou en tout cas, la partie relative au modèle de données
"

xsd - see https://vocab.belgif.be/ns?lang=en

OSLO standard: https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/adresregister/


**Questions:**
- where is the project charter ? **There is no project charter yet.**
- can we limit the exercise to putting a page on github with a picture of the datamodel and a reference to the (latest version) of the xsd ? without starting a classic ICEG exercise (which requires a budget) ? **In a first step, BOSA will refer to the latest version of the xsd on vocab.belgif. BOSA will include a page on github that will refer to this xsd and that will show a picture of the datamodel.**
- who can provide and publish the deliverables on the ICEG pages ? **BOSA will make an attempt.**
- when is the public review period foreseen ? **It is not the intention to change anything to the model that was agreed by the Address Committee. We are dealing here with a publication effort only and with a governance issue: the issues mechanism on github will be used to manage the lifecycle of the standard.** 

Next step: 
inform the Address Committee about the publication of the existing model on github

## The need for a more concerted Belgian Data Space approach (Raf Buyle - 15')
Europe has set its sights on the Data Economy, with the ambitious aim to create a Single Market for Data by 2030. Data must flow all around Europe to enable future innovations (e.g. based on AI) and improve the quality of European lives. But this doesn’t come easy, and there are a lot of barriers which need to be removed before we can get there. This is where Data Spaces come in. A Data Space can be understood as an ecosystem of organisations that are able to share data among each other more easily because of pre-made agreements that pertain to the technical, legal and business aspects of data sharing. 
Data Spaces are key to achieving sovereign (i.e. the owner of the data must remain in control of the data), interoperable and trustworthy data-sharing across the private and public sector. They play a key role towards the data economy of the future. Multiple Data Spaces are being developed at the European level[1], but also in other member states. In addition, an investment program has been established as part of the Digital Europe funding program.
Belgium however, is lagging behind. Certain local stakeholders are involved in the creation of Data Spaces, but their actions are currently fragmented. If Belgium wants to reap the benefits that Data Spaces have to offer, a more concerted approach between the research, private and public sector is needed. The is what the Belgian Data Spaces Hub (BDSH) aims to do. It will work on uniting local stakeholders, unifying Belgium’s Data Space vision to ensure that Belgium can become a frontrunner in the future data economy.

The BDSH will support local Data Space stakeholders in the development of EU Data Spaces. This will be achieved by connecting with European actors, projects and stakeholders, and by facilitating the inception of local Belgian Data Space implementations. The BDSH will not execute any projects, in order to remain a neutral entity that can be trusted by all actors in the various ecosystems with which it will interact. The BDSH will focus on the following objectives:
1.	Europe to Belgium: Allow EU-level developments to become available to the Belgian data economy 
2.	Belgium to Europe: Represent Belgian stakeholders in different European Data Spaces related associations
3.	Belgian European participation: Ensure that Belgian organisations can participating in the EU Data Spaces
4.	Belgian uptake: Stimulate local data ecosystems to initiate local Data Space projects

**Questions:**
- who is behind BDSH ? is it an organization ? is it a project ? **Jelle Hoedemaekers (agoria) explains that it is a project.**
- how is it related to ICEG data standardization efforts ?  **At European level they want to know where data standards in the Member States are coming from. ICEG is an initiative for data standardization at Belgian interfederal level. Raf Buyle wll serve as connection between ICEG and BDSH.** 

## Update on Legal thesauri (UTU) (Diederik Boomputte/Bart Hanssens - 5')
The following link leads to a publication of UTU on github: https://github.com/belgif/thematic/tree/master/legal-thesauri/utu

The UTU exercise does not follow a classic ICEG trajectory.
- mapping UTU <=> court of Cassation <=> eurovoc
- deliverable: SKOS mapping

Stakeholders:
- vzw  Pieter-Jan Montens
- court of Cassation (competing thesaurus)
- retired judges who created UTU (universele thesaurus universel - used by Strada Lex - available in Excel format)
- IGO instituut gerechtelijke opleiding
- FPS Justice
- Justice houses in the regions
- judges, lawyers, citizens, companies, human rights organizations, ..

Opendata legislation
- all (anonymised) court rulings have to be published as open data

**Questions:**
- status - **UTU has been published on github.**
- alignment court of Cassation - Eurovoc ? **This alignment is still to be done.**
- alignment UTU - court of Cassation ? **This alignment is still to be done.**
- who will do the publication work on github ?
- timing of the review period ?

## OSLO Leercredentials (Eveline Vlassenroot 5')
[OSLO Leercredentials](https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/standaard-in-ontwikkeling/vocabularium-en-applicatieprofiel-leercredential.html?_cldee=aFUO6jUdFYY08LyWBatrEioC3RWpgO70BawJ8e2G0Upnmue0_oXlyVYYD4fXCMD7&recipientid=contact-cea8ee18972deb11a813000d3ad7ac46-078d477fca004b5aacfcf30be8620acd&esid=1807d2ce-c990-ed11-aad1-0022489fdf62)

François Du Mortier: "Ik stel voor bij ICEG te polsen of er interesse is om dit uit te breiden naar het Federale, het Waalse gewest en de Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles toe. Ook in net kader van de Single Digital Gateway zullen we dergelijk standaard nodig hebben om te voldoen aan het Once Only beginsel."

Flanders has foreseen to start an OSLO exercise around this subject.

**Questions:** 
- move it to ICEG level ? **Digitaal Vlaanderen prefers to continue with its OSLO exercise which is open for everyone (see [subscription link](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/kennishub/werkgroepen-%E2%80%93-oslo-leercredential?_cldee=aFUO6jUdFYY08LyWBatrEioC3RWpgO70BawJ8e2G0Upnmue0_oXlyVYYD4fXCMD7&recipientid=contact-cea8ee18972deb11a813000d3ad7ac46-078d477fca004b5aacfcf30be8620acd&esid=1807d2ce-c990-ed11-aad1-0022489fdf62))**
- interest from french speaking community ? **No representatives were present in the meeting.**
- interest from german speaking community ? **No representatives were present in the meeting.**
- link with Single Digital Gateway ? **EMREX/ELMO is being examined right now by the EC.**
