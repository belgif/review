## The need for a more concerted Belgian Data Space approach (Raf Buyle - 15')
Europe has set its sights on the Data Economy, with the ambitious aim to create a Single Market for Data by 2030. Data must flow all around Europe to enable future innovations (e.g. based on AI) and improve the quality of European lives. But this doesn’t come easy, and there are a lot of barriers which need to be removed before we can get there. This is where Data Spaces come in. A Data Space can be understood as an ecosystem of organisations that are able to share data among each other more easily because of pre-made agreements that pertain to the technical, legal and business aspects of data sharing. 
Data Spaces are key to achieving sovereign (i.e. the owner of the data must remain in control of the data), interoperable and trustworthy data-sharing across the private and public sector. They play a key role towards the data economy of the future. Multiple Data Spaces are being developed at the European level[1], but also in other member states. In addition, an investment program has been established as part of the Digital Europe funding program.
Belgium however, is lagging behind. Certain local stakeholders are involved in the creation of Data Spaces, but their actions are currently fragmented. If Belgium wants to reap the benefits that Data Spaces have to offer, a more concerted approach between the research, private and public sector is needed. The is what the Belgian Data Spaces Hub (BDSH) aims to do. It will work on uniting local stakeholders, unifying Belgium’s Data Space vision to ensure that Belgium can become a frontrunner in the future data economy.

The BDSH will support local Data Space stakeholders in the development of EU Data Spaces. This will be achieved by connecting with European actors, projects and stakeholders, and by facilitating the inception of local Belgian Data Space implementations. The BDSH will not execute any projects, in order to remain a neutral entity that can be trusted by all actors in the various ecosystems with which it will interact. The BDSH will focus on the following objectives:
1.	Europe to Belgium: Allow EU-level developments to become available to the Belgian data economy 
2.	Belgium to Europe: Represent Belgian stakeholders in different European Data Spaces related associations
3.	Belgian European participation: Ensure that Belgian organisations can participating in the EU Data Spaces
4.	Belgian uptake: Stimulate local data ecosystems to initiate local Data Space projects

**Questions:**
- who is behind BDSH ? 
- is it an organization ? 
- is it a project ?
- how is it related to ICEG data standardization efforts ?

## Update on Legal thesauri (UTU) (Diederik Boomputte/Bart Hanssens - 5')
The UTU exercise does not follow a classic ICEG trajectory.
- mapping UTU <=> court of Cassation <=> eurovoc
- deliverable: SKOS mapping

Stakeholders:
- vzw  Pieter-Jan Montens
- court of Cassation (competing thesaurus)
- retired judges who created UTU (universele thesaurus universel - used by Strada Lex - available in Excel format)
- IGO instituut gerechtelijke opleiding
- FPS Justice
- Justice houses in the regions
- judges, lawyers, citizens, companies, human rights organizations, ..

Opendata legislation
- all (anonymised) court rulings have to be published as open data

**Questions:**
- status
- alignment UTU - court of Cassation ?
- who will do the publication work on github ?
- timing of the review period ?

## OSLO Leercredentials (Eveline Vlassenroot 5')
[OSLO Leercredentials](https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/standaard-in-ontwikkeling/vocabularium-en-applicatieprofiel-leercredential.html?_cldee=aFUO6jUdFYY08LyWBatrEioC3RWpgO70BawJ8e2G0Upnmue0_oXlyVYYD4fXCMD7&recipientid=contact-cea8ee18972deb11a813000d3ad7ac46-078d477fca004b5aacfcf30be8620acd&esid=1807d2ce-c990-ed11-aad1-0022489fdf62)

François Dumortier: "Ik stel voor bij ICEG te polsen of er interesse is om dit uit te breiden naar het Federale, het Waalse gewest en de Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles toe. Ook in net kader van de Single Digital Gateway zullen we dergelijk standaard nodig hebben om te voldoen aan het Once Only beginsel."

Flanders has foreseen to start an OSLO exercise around this subject.

**Questions:** 
- move it to ICEG level ? 
- interest from french/german speaking community ?
- interest from french/german speaking community ?
- link with Single Digital Gateway ? (EMREX/ELMO being examined right now by the EC)
