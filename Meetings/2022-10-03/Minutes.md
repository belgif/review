# Usage of ICEG budget 2022

- Hydrants: the data standardization can start; there is no dependency with other exercises; Rink will provide a list with people interested in participating at the workshops
- Procedures Moving: here also, the exercise can start
- Consumption of budget in 2023 - Issue or not ? the budget contributors will be contacted so that issues with invoices in 2023 will be avoided

# Status exercise with FPS Justice (UTU)
There are 2 thesauri which explain juridical terms: 
- UTU developed by retired judges
- Court of Cassation

UTU has been published on belgif - see https://vocab.belgif.be/auth/utu2021?lang=fr.
The question will be asked at the Court of Cassation whether they too are interested in publishing their thesaurus on belgif.
Afterwards an exercise could be started to map the terms on each other and/or on existing  international vocabularies.

A text will be written to allow the regions/communities to check if an interest exists in such vocabularies. Flanders thinks there is. The Walloon region thinks there could be interest at SPW side and in the academic world. 

# Status exercise with FPS Mobility
FPS Mobility has been contacted, but there is no news from that side.

Flanders confirms that the vocabulary is already online - see https://purl.eu/doc/applicationprofile/netex-belgium/timetables-ap/.
An application profile is coming (nearly finished).
Once finalized, the public review period could start.

Later this week, on Oct 6, ITS organizes a conference on Mobility in Brussels at which ICEG will be mentioned in order to develop new mobility standards in Belgium.

# When to apply which standard (question from training session) ?
The question 'where to find standards' has partially been answered via a page on Github - see https://github.com/belgif/review/tree/master/OverviewStandards.

The real question is what standard to use and where to find help for implementing a standard.

The ICEG review committee can be approached for this (e.g. via github o via one of the members of the review committee).

# Building exercise - status - how to cope with diverging opinions ?
Worst case is that there cannot be found a consensus: there simply is no standard then.

If there are several opinions, pros and cons about how the different proposals match with the defined use cases can be weighed and be submitted to a decision body (e.g. in this case the BUNI committee) which hopefully can arrive at a consensus then.

# Varia
NGI asks if there is news re the coming Belgian presidency of the EU in the context of ICEG.
