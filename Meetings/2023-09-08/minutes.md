The meeting started with a small introduction round to welcome the new participants from CFWB and Paradigm.

The role of the ICEG review committee and the expectations towards its members was clarified.
- bridge between ICEG committee and the govermental domain (status, budget, ..)
- following of the defined process to come to an interfederal data standard
- introduction of new standardization initiatives via the ICEG review committee, then to the ICEG committee for approval
- finding the right business experts within the governmental organizations to participate at the standardization workshops thus ensuring that no relevant contributors are forgotten

The status of the different initiatives was looked at (see attached support document).
- Building: to be approved by CC INSPIRE
- Hydrants: ongoing; an Excel input file was requested by some members of the workgroup
- Timetable: 15 issues still to be solved (10md of work); Geert Thijs can work on this as from October
- Person: legal aspects are looked at; a multi-language tooling issue is to be solved
- Toolchain: moving the existing toolchain to the belgif environment is ongoing; Eric asked if that toolchain could also be available at regional level

Raf Buyle presented a draft note that will be addressed to the members of the ICEG committee; this note contains a proposal for the budget of 2024 and can be used for discussion with the cabinets of the ministers. The review committee opted for not including in this strategic document a list with new initiatives and for having this discussion in a separate meeting of the ICEG review committee.

The meeting was concluded with an interesting overview of current initiatives at the level of the EU presented by Mathias Van Compernolle.
