## Observatorium (Ivy Van De Kerchove Digitaal Vlaanderen, bus. analyst)
Ivy presented the project ([link](https://www.interreg-fwvl.eu/nl/nieuws/binnenkort-een-grensoverschrijdend-observatorium)) for the constitution of a crossborder observatory by France, Wallonia and Flanders. The aim is to collect, harmonize and provide data related to domains such as agriculture, mobility, employment, health and water management.

ICEG could play a role in 3 ways:
- interoperability assessment by a NCA in the context of the Interoperable Europe Act
- support data standardization efforts
- translation of the OSLO standards to French (as foreseen in the new ICEG collaboration agreement)

## Interoperable Europe Act (Ziggy Vanlishout)
Ziggy explained the role of the National Competent Authority (NCA) in the context of the Interoperable Europe Act.
BE appointed 4 NCAs (including Ziggy and Dominique Buffet), Nicolas Vervaeck (BOSA) acting as central contact point.
The NCAs form a committee under the ICEG Committee.
Alignment between the ICEG NCA committee and the ICEG Review Committee will be done via Ziggy and Dominique.
Both committees report to the ICEG committee.

## Roadmap belgif website (Eveline Vlassenroot)
Eveline explains why a remake of belgif (currently maintained by BOSA) would be required.
Bart Hanssens and Bert Van Nuffelen have examined the publication flow which can be further enhanced, also taking into consideration the translations and publications of OSLO standards that are foreseen in the new collaboration agreement.
She also emphasizes the need for a more user friendly way of finding the standards.
The topic will be addressed at the next ICEG committee.

## Status ICEG agreement (Marc Bruyland)
BOSA did not receive requests to further update the collaboration agreement (deadline for reactions was 20/1).
The agreement waits for the approval by BOSA's IF after which the signing round can start.
Eric confirms that Marnix Tack will sign the agreement for Paradigm.

## Draft agenda items for ICEG Management committee (25/04)
The following topics can be discussed:
- Assuming the collaboration agreement will have been signed by 25/4, the ICEG committee can be informed that the pending projects will start or have been started.
- The roadmap for the belgif website 
- The interaction between the ICEG NCA committee and the ICEG review committee
Eveline and Dominique Buffet (tbc) volunteer to present.

## Code Régional de la Donnée (Eric Auquiere)
Eric explains the strategy with respect to data that is followed by the Brussels region. 
It consists of 7 workstreams.
The regional platform contains an integration hub, a data hub and a data catalog.
A part of the strategy has already been realized, another part was handed over to the Brussels Parliament in 2024 and is now waiting for the creation of a new government in the Brussels region.
